# Banking Management System

Welcome to the **Banking Management System**!  
This project is a demonstration of core banking operations, implemented in Assembly language. It is designed to simulate essential banking functionalities and provide hands-on experience with low-level programming and system design.

## 🚀 Overview

The Banking Management System is intended for educational and demonstration purposes, showing how fundamental banking tasks can be managed efficiently at the system level. Whether you are a student learning Assembly or a developer interested in financial software, this repository is a great place to explore algorithmic logic, data handling, and transaction management in one of the most performance-critical programming languages.

## ✨ Features

- **Customer Account Management:** Create, update, and delete customer records.
- **Secure Transactions:** Process deposits, withdrawals, and transfers with robust checks.
- **Balance Inquiry:** Check account balances instantly.
- **Transaction History:** Record and review recent account activity.
- **User Authentication:** Basic user validation mechanisms to protect account access.
- **Optimized for Performance:** Assembly code for maximum speed and resource efficiency.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Assembly Language:** The entire system logic is written in Assembly, offering both performance and transparency.
- **Command-line Interface:** Simple CLI for user interaction and system testing.

## 📦 Installation & Usage
